-- CREATE TABLES

-- Table: ZipCodes
-- Stores zip codes and their corresponding cities. Each zip code uniquely identifies a city.
-- Normalization:
-- - 1NF: Atomic columns (`ZipCode`, `City`).
-- - 2NF: `City` depends fully on `ZipCode` (the primary key).
-- - 3NF/BCNF: No transitive dependencies; `City` depends directly on `ZipCode`.
CREATE TABLE ZipCodes (
    ZipCode VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY, -- Unique identifier for each city

);

-- Table: Customers
-- Stores customer information, including their address and associated zip code.
-- Normalization:
-- - 1NF: Atomic columns (e.g., `FirstName`, `LastName`).
-- - 2NF: All attributes depend fully on `CustomerID`.
-- - 3NF/BCNF: `City` is stored in `ZipCodes`, avoiding transitive dependencies via `ZipCode`.

    FOREIGN KEY (ZipCode) REFERENCES ZipCodes(ZipCode) -- Ensures valid zip codes

-- Table: Artists
-- Stores information about artists who create paintings.
-- Normalization:
-- - 1NF: Atomic columns (e.g., `ArtistName`).
-- - 2NF: All attributes depend fully on `ArtistID`.
-- - 3NF/BCNF: No transitive dependencies; all attributes directly depend on `ArtistID`.

-- Table: Paintings
-- Stores information about paintings, including the artist who created each.
-- Normalization:
-- - 1NF: Atomic columns (e.g., `Title`).
-- - 2NF: All attributes depend fully on `PaintingID`.
-- - 3NF/BCNF: No transitive dependencies; `ArtistName` is not repeated here.

-- Stores information about the sale of paintings, including the customer, painting, and sale details.
-- Normalization:
-- - 1NF: Atomic columns (e.g., `SalePrice`).
-- - 2NF: All attributes depend fully on `SaleID`.
-- - 3NF/BCNF: No transitive dependencies; painting and customer details are referenced via foreign keys.
